# IATA Offer and Order Builds

Just a place for me to run, save and compare builds from the AIDM as the Standard is maintained.

For more information please get in touch or see https://guides.developer.iata.org/

Please note that you shouldn't use these buils for any production purposes. This is just for industry groups to review tchanges to the schemas.

Cheers,

Andrew
